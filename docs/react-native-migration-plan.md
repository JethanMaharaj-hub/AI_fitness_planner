## Apple Watch Integration

### Architecture
```
iPhone App ←→ Watch Connectivity ←→ Apple Watch App
     ↓              ↓                      ↓
 Supabase      Sync State            Watch Interface
     ↓              ↓                      ↓
   Cloud     Background Tasks         HealthKit
```

### Watch App Features
1. **Workout Timer Display**
   - Large, readable timer
   - Current exercise display
   - Progress indicators
   - Haptic feedback

2. **Workout Controls**
   - Start/pause/stop controls
   - Next exercise navigation
   - Emergency stop button

3. **Health Integration**
   - Heart rate monitoring
   - Calorie tracking
   - Workout sessions in Health app
   - Activity ring contributions

### Implementation Components

#### WatchOS App (Swift)
```swift
// WatchWorkoutManager.swift
class WatchWorkoutManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentTimer: WorkoutTimer?
    @Published var heartRate: Double = 0
    private var healthStore = HKHealthStore()
    private var session: WCSession?
    
    func startWorkout(_ workout: WorkoutDay) {
        // Start HealthKit workout session
        // Initialize timer
        // Begin heart rate monitoring
    }
    
    func syncWithPhone() {
        // Send workout progress to iPhone
        // Receive timer updates from iPhone
    }
}
```

#### React Native Bridge
```typescript
// WatchConnectivity.ts
import { WatchConnectivity } from 'react-native-watch-connectivity';

export class WorkoutWatchBridge {
  static async sendWorkoutToWatch(workout: WorkoutDay): Promise<void> {
    try {
      await WatchConnectivity.sendMessage({
        type: 'START_WORKOUT',
        payload: workout
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to send workout to watch:', error);
    }
  }
  
  static setupMessageListener(): void {
    WatchConnectivity.addMessageListener((message) => {
      switch (message.type) {
        case 'TIMER_UPDATE':
          this.handleTimerUpdate(message.payload);
          break;
        case 'WORKOUT_COMPLETE':
          this.handleWorkoutComplete(message.payload);
          break;
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Data & State Management

### State Architecture
```typescript
// AppState.ts
interface AppState {
  // User & Authentication
  user: User | null;
  userProfile: UserProfile;
  
  // Workout Data
  workoutPlan: WorkoutPlan | null;
  activeWorkoutDay: WorkoutDay | null;
  workoutHistory: WorkoutLog[];
  
  // Knowledge Base
  knowledgeSources: KnowledgeSource[];
  
  // UI State
  currentView: AppView;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  
  // Mobile-Specific
  watchConnected: boolean;
  backgroundTimers: Map<string, TimerState>;
}
```

### Data Synchronization Strategy
1. **Real-time Sync**: Supabase subscriptions for workout updates
2. **Offline Support**: AsyncStorage for local caching
3. **Watch Sync**: WatchConnectivity for real-time timer sync
4. **Health Sync**: HealthKit integration for workout data

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Apple Watch Complexity** 
   - *Risk*: WatchOS development learning curve
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple timer, expand gradually
   - *Impact*: Could delay Phase 4 by 2-3 weeks

2. **Expo to Bare Workflow** 
   - *Risk*: Ejecting from Expo managed workflow
   - *Mitigation*: Plan ejection early, test thoroughly
   - *Impact*: 1-2 weeks additional setup time

3. **HealthKit Integration** 
   - *Risk*: Complex permissions and data handling
   - *Mitigation*: Start integration early, use proven libraries
   - *Impact*: Could affect App Store approval

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Timer Background Processing**
   - *Risk*: iOS background limitations
   - *Mitigation*: Use proper background tasks, test extensively

2. **Gemini API on Mobile**
   - *Risk*: Network handling, error management
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust retry logic, offline graceful degradation

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - *Risk*: Sync conflicts between phone and watch
   - *Mitigation*: Implement conflict resolution, use timestamps

### Low-Risk Items
1. **UI Component Migration** - Direct React to React Native mapping
2. **Supabase Integration** - Proven React Native support
3. **TypeScript Setup** - Existing types can be largely reused
